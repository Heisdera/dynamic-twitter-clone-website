## Summary

After working on the youtube v2. i said welp twitter v2 isn't a bad idea tooðŸ˜….
This one gave me some tough time especially when trying to set up the like comment and retweet buttons, i think i spent about a day going back and fort trying out diffent if & else conditions and also googling because i wanted a real world feeling of like and retweeting just once on a post but the retweet and like button only functions best on a tweet independent on a tweet unless unliking or unretweeting then liking or retweeting another post so i instead i left it to like and retweet and much times possible on each post.
